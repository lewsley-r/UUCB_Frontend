    <h1 id="mainTitle">Why does this site exist?</h1>
    <p id="aboutContent">
      I have created this site for various reasons, the primary being as my own final year project.
      As part of my journey of initially thinkning of an idea, it was something I struggled with.
      So the idea of this project came to mind as way to combat other students being in my position of
      feeling stuck for ideas or inspiration for their projects. I also felt it could useful for students
      to document their trials and tribulations as they move through their own project developement. These 
      issues being documented somewhere may allow future students to learn and build on past students mistakes.
      This in turn (should) improve the quality of projects produced year on year by final year students.
